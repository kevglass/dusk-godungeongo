This is a rough hack up making using the Rune.ai SDK (https://rune.ai). I wanted to see what its all about and ended up recreating one of my dungeon games.

I make no apology for how raw the client rendering code is - I just went for it!

This one is about real time racing through a dungeon.

## How to Play

1. Choose a player, they're all the same at the moment but looks count.
2. Once the players are in the game the count down will start and eventuall the first room will unlock
3. Search the dungeon to find the 3 keys (gold, silver, bronze) and eventually unlock the door to the egg
4. Get the Egg to win the game
5. The minimap updates for everyone as people explore the dungeon. The first person to find the gold key also tells everyone else where it is.
6. Treasure gives extra points
7. Potion can be picked up and used for bonuses. One potion can be held at a time. Red = Health Recovery, Blue = Speed Boost

Have fun!
